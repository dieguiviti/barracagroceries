# barracagroceries
The grocery shopping app of Barraca, 61... MERN stack application deployed with heroku.

In order to run this app, you will have to connect it to your own Database URI.
For uri and jwt keys, I recommend using dotenv (.env) instead of config.get() with default.json.

To run.

1- cd into app root directory and run 'npm install'

2- cd into client folder and run 'npm install'

3- cd back into app root directory and run 'npm run development'
